Hello, 
My name is Srimukha and im passionate about robotics and AI! 

The steps i've followed:
Fork and clone you're forked repository(Forked the repo and then used the code 'git clone http://..." to clone the repo)
Make a folder in the root directory with your roll number("mkdir <Roll no>" )
Create a README.md file in your folder("echo. > README.md" after going to the folder in my cmd)
